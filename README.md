# Random-Color-Palatte
I have created a Radom color palatte generator on every reload. It is totally random, no color is repeated. It is build on Html, css and javascript. I have also used Flexbox in positioning the Color Palattes. In addition you can also copy the color to the clipboard and paste it anywhere.
